#' Input-Output Model
#'
#' A wrapper function to produce input-output analysis of the effects on the UK
#' economy of changes in the demand for combinations of alcohol, tobacco, food, and gambling. The model estimates
#' the impact of changes in final demand for unhealthy commodities, and the resulting changes in demand for other products,
#' on output, gross value added, employment, government tax receipts, and aggregate household earnings.
#'
#' Using publicly available data sources on expenditures on alcohol, tobacco, food, and gambling, the model
#' (i) calculates changes in expenditures at purchaser prices for user-specified proportionate changes in
#' expenditure, (ii) reallocates spending to other products according to user-specified options, (iii) converts
#' expenditures on all products from purchaser prices to basic prices by subtracting tax and imports, (iv) applies
#' the selected input-output to the resulting changes in demand in basic prices, and (v) estimates the consequent
#' economic outcomes.
#'
#' @param year Numeric. Year of expenditure, tax, and labour market outcomes data to use - default is 2019.
#' @param year_io Numeric. Year of input-output tables to use (select one from 2017. 2018, 2019, or 2020) - default is 2019.
#' @param base Numeric. Base year to use for inflation adjustment - default is 2019.
#' @param model_type Character. A public health model being used to supply inputs. One of c("none","healthei","stapm"). If "none" publicly
#' available aggregate data are used to calculate inputs with `GenExpenditure`. Otherwise `InputExpenditure` is used to process pre-prepared
#' changes in demand data from the respective model into inputs for the analysis.
#' @param input_data Data table. Input data on changes in demand derived from external sources.
#' @param reallocate_prop Numeric. Proportion of total change in spending reallocated to other products (0 to 1) - default is 1.
#' @param excluded_products Character vector. Products to exclude from reallocation. The products excluded can be any from
#' c("alcohol","tobacco","food","gambling") - default is to exclude all four categories.
#' @param change_food Numeric integer. Percentage change in expenditure on 19 categories of food;
#' 1. Milk, 2. Cheese, 3. Carcase meat, 4. Non-carcase meat and meat products, 5. Fish, 6. Eggs,
#' 7. Fats, 8. Sugar and preserves, 9. Potatoes, 10. Fruit and veg, 11. Bread, 12. Flour, 13. Cakes, buns, and pastries,
#' 14. Biscuits and crispbreads, 15. Cereals and cereal products, 16. Beverages, 17. Other food and drink, 18. Soft drinks,
#' 19. Confectionary.
#' @param change_gambling Numeric integer. Percentage change in expenditure (gross gambling yield) on 9
#' gambling categories (arcades, betting (non-remote), bingo (non-remote), casino (non-remote),
#' betting (remote), bingo (remote), casino (remote), lotteries, the National Lottery)
#' @param change_tobacco_licit Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 2
#' licit tobacco product categories (cigarettes, handrolled tobacco)
#' @param change_tobacco_illicit Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 2
#' illicit tobacco product categories (cigarettes, handrolled tobacco)
#' @param change_alcohol_on Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 4 alcohol
#' product categories in the on-trade (beer, cider, spirits, wine)
#' @param change_alcohol_off Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 4 alcohol
#' product categories in the off-trade (beer, cider, spirits, wine)
#' @param reallocate_food Numeric. Reallocating changed expenditure on food to other food categories.
#' Select one of the seven food categories in the input-output model to reallocate the changed spending
#' on food to; (1) meat and meat products (2) fish, fruit, and vegetables (3) oils and fats (4) dairy
#' products (5) grains and starch (6) bakery and farinaceous products (7) other food products. (Default value
#' is `NULL` which means no reallocation across food categories).
#' @param consumption_category Numeric integer. Takes on a value of 1-36 or NULL (default). If NULL, reallocated spending is
#' distributed on a pro-rata basis across the aggregate distribution of consumption across all 36 consumption categories. If
#' a value is specified, all consumption is allocated to the respective consumption category (See `cdohio.mod::coicop_categories` for an
#' index of the 36 consumption category). Note that this overrides any
#' restrictions imposed by `excluded_products` e.g. if "alcohol" is specified but `consumption_category` is set equal to 3
#' (alcoholic beverages), all expenditure will be reallocated to alcoholic beverages.
#' @param govt_spend Numeric. Changes in central government spending.
#' @param govt_allocation Numeric. options for the allocation of changes in central government spending. 1 for pro-rata
#' allocation according to the input-output tables. 2 for full allocation to health (CPA_Q86).
