\arguments{
\item{year}{Numeric. Year of expenditure, tax, and labour market outcomes data to use - default is 2022.}

\item{year_io}{Numeric. Year of input-output tables to use (select one from 2017 to 2022) - default is 2022.}

\item{base}{Numeric. Base year to use for inflation adjustment - default is 2022.}

\item{model_type}{Character. A public health model being used to supply inputs. One of c("none","healthei","stapm"). If "none" publicly
available aggregate data are used to calculate inputs with `GenExpenditure`. Otherwise `InputExpenditure` is used to process pre-prepared
changes in demand data from the respective model into inputs for the analysis.}

\item{input_data}{Data table. Input data on changes in demand derived from external sources.}

\item{reallocate_prop}{Numeric. Proportion of total change in spending reallocated to other products (0 to 1) - default is 1.}

\item{excluded_products}{Character vector. Products to exclude from reallocation. The products excluded can be any from
c("alcohol","tobacco","food","gambling") - default is to exclude all four categories.}

\item{change_food}{Numeric integer. Percentage change in expenditure on 19 categories of food;
1. Milk, 2. Cheese, 3. Carcase meat, 4. Non-carcase meat and meat products, 5. Fish, 6. Eggs,
7. Fats, 8. Sugar and preserves, 9. Potatoes, 10. Fruit and veg, 11. Bread, 12. Flour, 13. Cakes, buns, and pastries,
14. Biscuits and crispbreads, 15. Cereals and cereal products, 16. Beverages, 17. Other food and drink, 18. Soft drinks,
19. Confectionary.}

\item{change_gambling}{Numeric integer. Percentage change in expenditure (gross gambling yield) on 9
gambling categories (arcades, betting (non-remote), bingo (non-remote), casino (non-remote),
betting (remote), bingo (remote), casino (remote), lotteries, the National Lottery)}

\item{change_tobacco_licit}{Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 2
licit tobacco product categories (cigarettes, handrolled tobacco)}

\item{change_tobacco_illicit}{Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 2
illicit tobacco product categories (cigarettes, handrolled tobacco)}

\item{change_alcohol_on}{Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 4 alcohol
product categories in the on-trade (beer, cider, spirits, wine)}

\item{change_alcohol_off}{Numeric vector. Percentage change in expenditure on 4 alcohol
product categories in the off-trade (beer, cider, spirits, wine)}

\item{reallocate_food}{Numeric. Reallocating changed expenditure on food to other food categories.
Select one of the seven food categories in the input-output model to reallocate the changed spending
on food to; (1) meat and meat products (2) fish, fruit, and vegetables (3) oils and fats (4) dairy
products (5) grains and starch (6) bakery and farinaceous products (7) other food products. (Default value
is `NULL` which means no reallocation across food categories).}

\item{consumption_category}{Numeric integer. Takes on a value of 1-36 or NULL (default). If NULL, reallocated spending is
distributed on a pro-rata basis across the aggregate distribution of consumption across all 36 consumption categories. If
a value is specified, all consumption is allocated to the respective consumption category (See `cdohio.mod::coicop_categories` for an
index of the 36 consumption category). Note that this overrides any
restrictions imposed by `excluded_products` e.g. if "alcohol" is specified but `consumption_category` is set equal to 3
(alcoholic beverages), all expenditure will be reallocated to alcoholic beverages.}

\item{govt_spend}{Numeric. Changes in central government spending.}

\item{govt_allocation}{Numeric. options for the allocation of changes in central government spending. 1 for pro-rata
allocation according to the input-output tables. 2 for full allocation to health (CPA_Q86).}

\describe{
  \item{`expenditure_change`}{Change in expenditure in Â£millions}
  \item{`final_demand`}{Modelled vector of final demand changes across 105 products}
  \item{`effects`}{Aggregate economic impacts - direct, indirect, and induced}
  \item{`effects_pct`}{Aggregate economic impacts - direct, indirect, and induced (percent of UK total)}
  \item{`baseline`}{Totals of each economic outcome in the UK}
  \item{`type0_effects_by_product`}{direct economic impacts for each product}
  \item{`type1_effects_by_product`}{direct + indirect economic impacts for each product}
  \item{`type2_effects_by_product`}{direct + indirect + induced economic impacts for each product}
  \item{`multipliers`}{type1 and type2 multipliers for output and gross value added}
}
}
\description{
A wrapper function to produce input-output analysis of the effects on the UK
economy of changes in the demand for combinations of alcohol, tobacco, food, and gambling. The model estimates
the impact of changes in final demand for unhealthy commodities, and the resulting changes in demand for other products,
on output, gross value added, employment, government tax receipts, and aggregate household earnings.
}
\details{
Using publicly available data sources on expenditures on alcohol, tobacco, food, and gambling, the model
(i) calculates changes in expenditures at purchaser prices for user-specified proportionate changes in
expenditure, (ii) reallocates spending to other products according to user-specified options, (iii) converts
expenditures on all products from purchaser prices to basic prices by subtracting tax and imports, (iv) applies
the selected input-output to the resulting changes in demand in basic prices, and (v) estimates the consequent
economic outcomes.
