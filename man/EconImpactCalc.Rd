}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Numeric. Year of expenditure, tax, and labour market outcomes data to use.}

\item{year_io}{Numeric. Year of input-output tables to use (select one from 2017. 2018, 2019, or 2020) - default is 2020.}

\item{input_vector}{Numeric vector. The vector of length 105 of changes in final demand in basic prices.}

\item{alcohol_tax}{Numeric. Change in tax less subsidies on products for alcohol calculated from `GenExpenditure()` function.}

\item{tobacco_tax}{Numeric. Change in tax less subsidies on products for tobacco calculated from `GenExpenditure()` function.}

\description{
Apply the input-output model parameters to a pre-specified vector of changes in final demand for 105 products. Calculate
